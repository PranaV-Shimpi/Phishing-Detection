 Changes to eBay User Agreement and Privacy Policy Dear jnazario, I'm writing to let you know that the eBay User Agreement and eBay Privacy Policy have been updated, effective immediately for users registering as of Nov
 22, 2005, and effective February 1, 2006 for current users
 The rules and dispute resolution policies you originally agreed to have not changed in any substantive way
 The User Agreement has been rewritten, however, to cover new features such as Reviews & Guides, changes in the collection of overdue seller fees, and to better meet the needs of our growing user community
 The new Privacy Policy, like the old one, outlines the broad categories of information we collect from you based on your activities on the site and public data sources
 It also now specifically calls out the fact that eBay does not sell your personal information for marketing purposes and directs you to a page where you can select how you wish to be contacted by eBay
 If you would like to receive advance notice of pricing promotions, events, and other updates, be sure to select "Newsletters, promotions, and event notifications" in your Notification Preferences
 If you accept the new User Agreement and Privacy Policy, you don't need to take any action
 If you do not wish to accept the new User Agreement or Privacy Policy, please refer to our Frequently Asked Questions about the User Agreement Revision for instructions on what to do
 Thank you for using eBay and we look forward to many more successful transactions
 Sincerely, Scott R
 Shipman, CIPP Senior Counsel, Global Privacy Practices eBay Inc
