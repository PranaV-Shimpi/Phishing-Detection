 Question from skaubraatmyra Hello, Hi, I signed up for Ebay and I've been an Ebay member for about 15 days
 So, I'm carrying an "icon" where it says "I am a member since less than 30 days"
 A few days ago, I managed to sell an item
 The guy who bought mine left me a positive feedback
 But still, mine's got a "zero" feedback
 Why is it that
 If I click on my profile, I can see that he left me a feedback
 But the feedback counting doesn't go from zero to one
 Is it because I'm a member who's been registered for less than 30 days

Regards, Gretta
