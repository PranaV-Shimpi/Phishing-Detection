Section1 {page:Section1;} --> Dear Chase account holder, We recently reviewed your account, and suspect that your Chase Internet Banking account may have been accessed by an unauthorized third party

 To restore your account access, please take the following steps to ensure that your account has not been compromised: 1
 Login to your Chase Internet Banking account
 In case you are not enrolled for Internet Banking, you will have to use your Social Security Number as both your Personal ID and Password
 2
 Review your recent account history for any unauthorized withdrawals or deposits, and check your account profile to make sure not changes have been made
 If any unauthorized activity has taken place on your account, report this to Chase staff immediately
 Click here to activate your account We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, and appreciate your assistance in helping us maintain the integrity of the entire Chase system
