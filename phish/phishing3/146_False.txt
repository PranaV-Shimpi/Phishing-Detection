Subject: eBay Billing Department Dear Valued Ebay Member, It has come to our attention that your Ebay Billing information records needs updated for the year 2006
 This requires you to update your billing information
 If you could please take 5-10 minutes out of your online experience and update your billing records
 You will not run into any future problems with your Ebay online services
 However, failure to update your records will result in account termination
 If you would like to keep your account please update your ebay account as soon as possible
 Once you have updated your account records, your ebay session will not be interrupted and will continue as normal
 Failure to update will result in cancellation of service, Terms of Service (TOS) violations or future billing problems
 Please Update HERE Thank you for your time
