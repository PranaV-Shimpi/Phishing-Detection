html Growth Equity Corp
 has discovered a diamond in the rough that is being polished to a brilliant shine
 Timing and Momentum are everything
 We believe 80%+ surge last week is just the prelude to AIMTs rise to the $6-$8 range in the next 60 days


 We are excited to have found this opportunity to buy in advance of the market demand
 Read on to find out why we are so confident of this stock pick being a Huge Winner
 (OTCBB: AIMT ) No Pump and Dump here
 AIMSI Technologies Inc
 (OTCBB: AIMT ) is a solid company with an exciting future
 In business over 10 years, profitable each year
 Exclusive worldwide distribution rights for the Automatic Large Area Remote Mapper (ALARM)
 A cutting edge technology patented by the University of Alabama at Huntsville , that can detect radioactive dirty bombs, chemical and biological threats
 Signed $225 million dollar contract for the ALARM with China Global Distribution Corp
 This contract alone should generate over $100 million dollars in profit to AIMT, and that's just in Asia 
 The U
S
 Department of Homeland Security has a $44 billion dollar budget, and AIMT is well positioned to tap into this budget with contracts that may dwarf the Asian contract
 ALARM units already in production, first units passed rigorous testing by highly regarded Oak Ridge Labs in Tennessee 
 CEO NEWS IS BEST OF ALL
 Savvy investors say this CEO MOVE is stronger than a garlic milkshake 
 Reginald Hall, Chairman and CEO, has revised his employment agreement with the company
 He is so excited and confident about the future growth prospects of the company, that he has canceled over 36 million shares previously issued to him, and has agreed to receive compensation based on future performance of the company
 See Press Release: http://biz

com/bw/041119/195236_1
html Since this represents more than half of the issued and outstanding shares of stock in the company, it won't take the market long to realize that the price per share should double in value
 That's good newsbut it gets better
 At the same time Mr
 Hall cancelled his stock, the company approved a 5 for 1 forward stock split
 The company felt that a growth stock is much more attractive to investors at a lower price
 (Notwithstanding the company's intention to apply soon for a listing on the American Stock Exchange; AMEX
 ) Remember, this stock is undervalued by at least 50% because the outstanding shares have been reduced by 50%
